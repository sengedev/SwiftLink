4. **Bind your Domain**:
   Please don't forget to bind your domain name after the installation is complete, domain names are more secure and reliable compared to IP addresses.
   In production environment, you can use Nginx, Apache or Caddy to bind your domain name, it is recommended to use Caddy for binding, but you can also choose a http server what you want.
   Nginx, Apache, and Caddy are three commonly used web servers, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
- **[Nginx](https://nginx.org/)**: Nginx is a good choice if high concurrency performance and low memory consumption are required, especially for processing static content and reverse proxying.
- **[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)**: If you need rich features and module support, as well as good compatibility, Apache may be more suitable.
- **[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)**: If you wish to simplify HTTPS configuration and need an easy-to-configure server, Caddy is a good choice.
